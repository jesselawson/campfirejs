# Welcome to Campfire

Campfire is an engine for dynamic content.

Content is stored on <c cards -> how_fun c>. When you click a regular link, a 
new card is revealed underneath the currently active card. 

Another kind of link is a <c clear link -> basic_examples and clear c>; a clear link 
will clear all cards before displaying the target card.

$begin how_fun 
Isn't this neat?
