This card starts with markdown, <c [[contains a link]] -> next_card c>, and has two paragraphs.

Here's the **second** paragraph. 

<c [[This whole paragraph is a campfire expression]] -> last_card c>.

And here's a paragraph with _just_ markdown.

This is a card body. We can expect **markdown** in 
a _variety of forms_, and also some Campfire expressions.

A Campfire expression will be rendered just like a normal 
link -- <c like this! -> next_card c>
